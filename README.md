Description of my previous developments:

Ramadan/Prayer Web Progressive Web Application:
https://medium.com/@omaros/the-need-for-a-modern-and-better-athan-app-72c63f75ff42
-	PWA that processes a variety of data to display prayer times and is specifically catered for the Islamic month of Ramadan. The app utilizes location data and displays a modern timer, along with curated, useful features to benefit users, and is also optimized for mobile and desktop devices. I have also written an article on Medium that highlights features and use-cases for this application. This was a one of the projects that I converted to react, see the original application, and the current version

Work for the Islamic Center of Lansing;
â€¢	Personally created a unique and proprietary software to better facilitate prayer times, including a pipeline that enabled different teams to work together, with a front-end app on their website for patrons to see important information with minimal downtime.
- Created a zakat calculator that helped people figure out the correct amount to donate during the year.

Video Streaming Web Application
-	Created a custom video player, using HTML and JavaScript, utilizing built in APIs in the browser like Local Storage. Cloud services including Firebase. Fetch library used to gather data (titles, hyperlinks) from resources, and further optimization to save internet usage, like preloading images only when scrolling to that specific section.
