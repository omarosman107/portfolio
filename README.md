# Omar Osman: Portfolio
Description of my previous developments:

Ramadan/Prayer Web Progressive Web Application:
https://medium.com/@omaros/the-need-for-a-modern-and-better-athan-app-72c63f75ff42

•	Built a modern prayer app for both mobile and desktop users using React, HTML and, CSS, leading to 3.7k+ unique sessions
•	Maintaining and adding changes over time including optimizations, performance improvements, and UX to enhance the overall experience for each user
•	Utilized Git when pushing updates to main branch to allow for future collaboration and the ability to see past commit history, or previous versions of code
•	Improved organizational skills by publishing an article on Medium that highlights features and use-cases for this application to further elaborate on the processes and reasoning of certain choices during creation


-	PWA that processes a variety of data to display prayer times and is specifically catered for the Islamic month of Ramadan. The app utilizes location data and displays a modern timer, along with curated, useful features to benefit users, and is also optimized for mobile and desktop devices. I have also written an article on Medium that highlights features and use-cases for this application. This was a one of the projects that I converted to react, see the original application, and the current version.
AthanApp has been maintained for the last few months to ensure stability, along with general improvments and additional features.

Work for the Islamic Center of Lansing;
•	Personally created a unique and proprietary software to better facilitate prayer times, including a pipeline that enabled different teams to work together, with a front-end app on their website for patrons to see important information with minimal downtime.


•	Developed and maintained custom software using OOP and JSON databases to create an efficient pipeline for handling future prayer times using AI and manual procedures with JavaScript, serving over 1.8k patrons.
•	Increased efficiency in application development by meeting with multiple leaders over several months to identify critical process improvements and develop sustainable solutions to engineering problems.
•	Participated in meetings and recorded notes of essential deadlines and components using Google Workspace, Notion, Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to ensure the needs of the board were met.
•	Increased operational efficiency and decreased reliance on manual tasks by developing a machine learning algorithm to predict Iqama times using historical data generated via a custom software and pipeline, outperforming the modulus rounding approach.

Video Streaming Web Application
-	Created a custom video player, using HTML and JavaScript, utilizing built in APIs in the browser like Local Storage. Cloud services including Firebase. FetchJS library used to gather data (titles, hyperlinks) from external resources, and further optimization to save internet usage, like preloading images only when scrolling to that specific section. 

Some tid-bits:
-	originally started with VideoJs as the core video player but moved to HLS.js for stability, better customizability and integration with a custom video UI.
-	 processing data from variety of sources to organize and store in a general format (JSON). 
-	 "Continue watching" section updates live, listening for changes in FireBase and localStorage.
-	 Different sized images served depending on what browser, and PPI a device has.
-	 anonymous user IDs to store in DB. QR code feature to sync multiple devices including smartphones.
-  Dark mode, depending on system display settings.
